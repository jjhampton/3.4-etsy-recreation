The hat sizes are what the cap measures (un-stretched), so the actual head size would be about 2 inches larger.\n\nFeel free to contact me with any custom requests or questions.  I&#39;d be happy to create a custom order that fits your needs.\n\nI can make a hat to fit any size head, please contact me with the circumference of the &quot;head size&quot; and I can knit it to fit it :)","creation_tsz":1431258744,"ending_tsz":1441885944,"original_creation_tsz":1377466899,"last_modified_tsz":1431258744,"price":"17.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":4,"tags":["Handmade","Teenage Mutant","Ninja Turtle","hat","knit","homemade","tmnt","ninja","tartarughe","Raphael","Leonardo","Michelangelo","Donatello"],"category_path":["Accessories","Hat"],"category_path_ids":[69150467,68891926],"materials":["machine washable"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1425395087,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/160701976\/hand-knit-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":22876,"num_favorers":1346,"shipping_template_id":10362675903,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"not_specified","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":25,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Hats & Caps"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":744241695,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1426728427,"listing_id":160701976,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/060\/1\/8503477\/il_75x75.744241695_hupb.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/060\/1\/8503477\/il_170x135.744241695_hupb.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/060\/1\/8503477\/il_570xN.744241695_hupb.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/060\/1\/8503477\/il_fullxfull.744241695_hupb.jpg","full_height":375,"full_width":564},{"listing_image_id":744241801,"hex_code":"7A9586","red":122,"green":149,"blue":134,"hue":147,"saturation":18,"brightness":58,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426728427,"listing_id":160701976,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/1\/8503477\/il_75x75.744241801_fkrr.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/1\/8503477\/il_170x135.744241801_fkrr.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/1\/8503477\/il_570xN.744241801_fkrr.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/1\/8503477\/il_fullxfull.744241801_fkrr.jpg","full_height":882,"full_width":1057},{"listing_image_id":699131107,"hex_code":"658068","red":101,"green":128,"blue":104,"hue":127,"saturation":21,"brightness":50,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1418530877,"listing_id":160701976,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8503477\/il_75x75.699131107_f3in.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8503477\/il_170x135.699131107_f3in.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8503477\/il_570xN.699131107_f3in.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8503477\/il_fullxfull.699131107_f3in.jpg","full_height":1086,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":663379134,"hex_code":"847D72","red":132,"green":125,"blue":114,"hue":37,"saturation":13,"brightness":51,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1412617035,"listing_id":160701976,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/052\/0\/8503477\/il_75x75.663379134_ctbu.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/052\/0\/8503477\/il_170x135.663379134_ctbu.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/052\/0\/8503477\/il_570xN.663379134_ctbu.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/052\/0\/8503477\/il_fullxfull.663379134_ctbu.jpg","full_height":852,"full_width":852},{"listing_image_id":744243543,"hex_code":"9C8B68","red":156,"green":139,"blue":104,"hue":40,"saturation":33,"brightness":61,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426728427,"listing_id":160701976,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/056\/1\/8503477\/il_75x75.744243543_nctc.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/056\/1\/8503477\/il_170x135.744243543_nctc.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/056\/1\/8503477\/il_570xN.744243543_nctc.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/056\/1\/8503477\/il_fullxfull.744243543_nctc.jpg","full_height":640,"full_width":640}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8503477,"shop_name":"DeviDoesKnit","user_id":15661896,"creation_tsz":1377461121,"title":null,"announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af)\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af)\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af) * THANK YOU FOR YOUR PURCHASE!
