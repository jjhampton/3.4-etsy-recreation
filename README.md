# Etsy Recreation


A recreation of Etsy's search results page for everyone's favorite search query - "ninjas".

I built this in week 3 at The Iron Yard Academy to practice using Javascript's AJAX methods to work with JSON API data and, and CSS/SASS to replicate the style of a predefined design.

##Tools & Techniques

- AJAX callbacks to retrieve large blocks of JSON data
- Handlebars templating for DOM insertion of JSON
- SASS and Bourbon for CSS styling and layout
- Bourbon Neat grid for responsive design for the search result columns
- Font Awesome Icons
