# Etsy Recreation

A recreation of Etsy's search results page for everyone's favorite search query - "ninjas".

I built this in week 3 at The Iron Yard Academy to practice using Javascript's AJAX methods to work with JSON API data, and CSS/SASS to replicate the style of a predefined design.

##Live Demo:
